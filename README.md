# Forked (vue-mdx)

This repository was forked from the good original work of [Mesut Koca](https://github.com/koca) on [Vue MDX](https://github.com/koca/vue-mdx)


The purpose of this fork is to solve an issue I personally had. I do note recommend using this in production, as I have no plans of deeply maintaining this fork.

Thanks! For questions, please refer to the [official `vite-plugin-mdx-vue` repo](https://github.com/koca/vue-mdx)
